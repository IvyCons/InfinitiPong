# InfinitiPong

InfinitiPong is a enhance reality experience, a performance piece, and a Pong game. 
In making this project, we want to incorparates midi instruments, live music performance, theatrical effects of the competition and playfullness in game play all into one. 
The game itself is coded in javascript, with real-time input and output monitoring of midi signals. Input midi signals from the Talbertronics we are using is being used to control the paddle, while the pong ball outputs midi signals of different pitches based on the positions.
Midi signals are being managed by MaxMSP.
There is a standalone visual portion that was being projected on top of the game, also being controlled by midi data, made in Isadora.
The Logic file and the Ableton Live have tracks of software synth/sound effects designed by Brock Bierly, that gets played in real time when the paddle is operated by the midi instruments. 
The background tracks in the game is made in VCV rack and voice synthesizer, by Hamish Robb and Brock Bierly.
